## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS**

AUTHOR NOTES:

- Used flexbox and grid for the layout
- Layout works* for mobile, iPad and desktop

*I have changed a lot of styling from mobile to desktop. I changed a lot of styles on the media queries of each section. For me, it's too much work and kind of confusing. I'll try to find a solution doing this less. Please message me if you have suggestions
